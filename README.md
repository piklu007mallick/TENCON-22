**Networkx_1:**

It is mainly for weighted parameter of network and some unweighted features;
Import latitude/longitude of all node-> make list of [airport, latitude,longitude];
Import freq. of flight/week of all node-> make list of [source , destination,freq];
Indian map(depends on position without link weightage);
In Degree of each node;
Avarage degree of Network;
In degree distribution weighted;
Cummulative degree distribution and power-law approximation;
Average Shortest Path of unweighted graph;
data taking between airport for table 1 (shortest path).



**Networkx_2:**

It is mainly for unweighted parameter of network and some weighted features;
weighted data taking between airport for table 1 (shortest path);
shortest path distribution;
Unweighted Average shortest path;
Clustering coeffecient.
